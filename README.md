# Capstone: Hawker Food AI

## Problem Statement

Singapore has nominated its Hawker Culture for the UNESCO’s Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in March 2019. Documentation is key to safeguarding our Intangible Cultural Heritage, and everyone is welcomed to make [online photo contributions](https://www.oursgheritage.sg/ourhawkerculture-online-photo-contributions/) to document Singapore’s hawker centres and food. Although most photos are tagged by their contributor, the traditional workflow of image labeling is tedious and inefficient. To make future photo archiving efforts on Singapore's food heritage easier and faster, the aim of this project is building an image classifier that can label Singapore hawker food pictures. To make the project manageable, I will be classifying 10 categories of food.
